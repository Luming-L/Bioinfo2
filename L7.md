diffenent to reference
DNA sequencing 
RNA-seq 
ChIP-seq 
ATAC-seq

bulk 
single-cell transcriptome

Why is RNA-seq read mapping hard? 
errors in the reads (mismatches, insertions, deletions)
errors in the reference
genetic variation
spliced mapping reads contains sequences in 2exons
multi-mapping
efficiency
